## You Need Both R and RStudio Installed

If you only downloaded RStudio onto your laptop it will not work. RStudio needs R to make it work.

Computers in the clusters have both software. You can try to download them onto your own laptop after this class.

* [Download and install the latest version of R here](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [Download and install RStudio here](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Introduction to RStudio

**Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

  * The interactive R console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="*When RStudio is first started, three panels are visible*.", fig.alt="A screenshot of Rstudio showing eleven menus at the top left. One panel covers the left half with text about the R software. The right is divided into two panels with text saying that the environment is empty in the top panel and a display of the current file directory in the bottom panel."}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/teaching_owl/RStudio_screenshot.png")
```

Once you open files, such as R scripts, another panel will open in the top left.

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='*Open a script by pressing the "New File" button, followed by "R Script"*.', fig.alt="Two zoomed in screenshots of the top left menus in RStudio. The first screenshot shows a black rectangle highlighting an icon which is a white square with a plus inside a green circle. The second screenshot shows a black rectangle highlighting a menu item that reads R Script followed by the associated keyboard shortcut, Ctrl + Shift + N."}

```


## Working in RStudio
There are two main ways one can work within RStudio.

1. Test and play within the interactive R console (bottom left) 
2. Start writing in an .R file (script) and use RStudio's short cut keys to run the commands in the R console.
   * This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
   * You will be able to run the .R file (script) you create from within RStudio.

**Tip: Running segments of your code**
:::

RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts.To run the current line, you can
1. click on the `Run` button above the editor panel, or  
2. select "Run Lines" from the "Code" menu, or  
3. hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> in Windows or Linux or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> on OS X.
(This shortcut can also be seen by hovering the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.
::::

The simplest thing you could do with R is do arithmetic:

```{r}
1 + 100
```

And R will print out the answer, with a preceding "[1]". Don't worry about this. For now think of it as indicating what line the output is on.

If you type in an incomplete command, R will wait for you to
complete it:

~~~
> 1 +
~~~


~~~
+
~~~


Any time you run a command and the R session shows a "+" instead of a ">", it
means it's waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel
a command you can hit "Esc" and RStudio will give you back the ">" prompt.

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
obtaining a package written by someone else. As of this writing, there
are over 18,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive
network). R and RStudio have functions for managing packages:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can load a package and make it available for use with `library(packagename)`

> **Challenge 1**

> Which of the following are valid R variable names?
> ```{r, eval=FALSE}
> min_height
> max.height
> _age
> MaxLength
> min-length
> 2widths
> celsius2kelvin

<details>
  <summary>**Solution to Challenge 1**</summary>

The following can be used as R variables:
```{r ch1pt1-sol, eval=FALSE}
min_height
max.height
MaxLength
celsius2kelvin
```

The following will not be able to be used to create a variable
```{r ch1pt3-sol, eval=FALSE}
_age
min-length
2widths
```
